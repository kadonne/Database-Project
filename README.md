## Usage Examples

### Query Execution Examples

**Example 1: List workers alphabetically (Query 1)**

```sql
SELECT per_id, last_name, first_name
FROM person
ORDER BY last_name ASC, first_name ASC;
```

**Example 2: Find skill gaps (Query 6)**

```sql
-- Skills required for position but not possessed by person
SELECT s.sk_code, s.sk_title, s.sk_level
FROM skill s
WHERE s.sk_code IN (
    SELECT r.sk_code
    FROM requires r
    WHERE r.pos_code = '15'
)
AND s.sk_code NOT IN (
    SELECT h.sk_code
    FROM has_skill h
    WHERE h.per_id = '7'
)
ORDER BY s.sk_title;
```

**Example 3: Inventory alerts (Query 9)**

```sql
SELECT item_num, title, quantity, min_level
FROM inventory
WHERE CAST(quantity AS INTEGER) < CAST(min_level AS INTEGER)
ORDER BY (CAST(min_level AS INTEGER) - CAST(quantity AS INTEGER)) DESC;
```

**Example 4: Top-paying qualified positions (Query 20)**

```sql
SELECT pos.pos_code, pos.pos_title, pos.pay_range_high
FROM position pos
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT r.sk_code
    FROM requires r
    WHERE r.pos_code = pos.pos_code
    AND r.sk_code NOT IN (
        SELECT h.sk_code
        FROM has_skill h
        WHERE h.per_id = '7'
    )
)
ORDER BY pos.pay_range_high DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

### Java Application Examples

**Example: Execute Query with JDBC**

```java
public static void executeQuery(Connection conn, String query) {
    try {
        Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();
        ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(query);
        
        ResultSetMetaData rsmd = rs.getMetaData();
        int columnCount = rsmd.getColumnCount();
        
        // Print column headers
        for (int i = 1; i <= columnCount; i++) {
            System.out.printf("%-20s", rsmd.getColumnName(i));
        }
        System.out.println();
        
        // Print results
        while (rs.next()) {
            for (int i = 1; i <= columnCount; i++) {
                System.out.printf("%-20s", rs.getString(i));
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
        
        rs.close();
        stmt.close();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
```

**Example: Transaction with Rollback**

```java
public static void executeTransaction(Connection conn) {
    try {
        conn.setAutoCommit(false);
        
        Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();
        
        // Execute multiple related operations
        stmt.executeUpdate("INSERT INTO contract VALUES (...)");
        stmt.executeUpdate("INSERT INTO purchase VALUES (...)");
        
        // Commit if all succeed
        conn.commit();
        System.out.println("Transaction completed successfully");
        
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        try {
            conn.rollback();
            System.out.println("Transaction rolled back");
        } catch (SQLException ex) {
            ex.printStackTrace();
        }
    } finally {
        try {
            conn.setAutoCommit(true);
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

## Database Design Highlights

### Normalization

All schemas are designed in **3rd Normal Form (3NF)**:

* **1NF**: All attributes contain atomic values
* **2NF**: No partial dependencies on composite keys
* **3NF**: No transitive dependencies

**Key Functional Dependencies:**

**LD Database:**
```
per_id → last_name, first_name, address, zip_code, email, gender
sk_code → sk_title, sk_description, sk_level
pos_code → pos_title, description, pay_range_high, pay_range_low
job_code → j_title, comp_id, pos_code, emp_mode, pay_rate, pay_type, cate_code
comp_id → industry_group, address, zip_code, website
c_code → c_title, c_level, description, status, retail_price
```

**AZ Database:**
```
store_id → address, zip_code, phone
item_num → title, description, quantity, unit, avg_cost, min_level, shelf_code
sup_id → address, zip_code, phone, balance
pur_num, complete_date → sup_id, item_num, quantity, unit_cost
```

**GV Database:**
```
fac_id → fac_name, address, zip_code, phone, manager
m_code → m_name, quantity, unit, min_level
p_code → p_name, description, quantity, unit, avg_cost
contract_id → cus_id, date, sale_amount, pay_schedule
```

### Design Decisions

**1. Employment History Tracking (LD only):**
* `Works` relationship includes start and end dates
* AZ and GV only track current employment
* Enables career progression analysis in LD

**2. Skill Level Granularity:**
* Three-tier system: beginner, intermediate, advanced
* Allows precise matching and training recommendations
* Supports progression tracking

**3. Flexible Job Requirements:**
* Position-level requirements (`Requires`)
* Job-specific additional requirements (`Addi_Requires` in AZ)
* Accommodates varying job complexities

**4. Industry Classification:**
* GICS hierarchy implementation
* Supports sector, industry group, industry, sub-industry
* Enables industry-wide analytics

**5. Date Storage:**
* Separate year, month, day columns
* Simplifies date range queries
* Avoids date format inconsistencies

**6. Pay Type Flexibility:**
* Supports both wage (hourly) and salary (annual)
* 1920 hours standard for annual calculations (40 hrs/week × 48 weeks)
* Enables consistent compensation comparisons

## Query Complexity Analysis

### Simple Queries (2 points each)
* Basic SELECT with ORDER BY
* Single table filtering
* Straightforward aggregations

### Intermediate Queries (3 points each)
* Multi-table JOINs
* Subqueries
* GROUP BY with HAVING
* Date range filtering

### Advanced Queries (5 points each)
* Complex subqueries (nested, correlated)
* Set operations (UNION, INTERSECT, EXCEPT)
* Advanced aggregations
* Skill gap analysis with multiple levels

### Expert Queries (7 points each)
* Multi-level optimization problems
* Recursive queries (prerequisite chains)
* Complex set theory operations
* Multiple database coordination

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing

**Test each query with known data:**

```sql
-- Test Query 1: Workers alphabetically
-- Expected: 5 workers ordered by last name
-- Brown, Jones, Johnson, Smith, Williams

-- Test Query 6: Skill gaps
-- Given: Person 7, Position 15
-- Expected: Skills in position but not in person's skill set
```

### Integration Testing

**Test business processes:**

* Employee hiring workflow (all 5 steps)
* Worker transfer with foreign key updates
* Transaction rollback scenarios
* Multi-database synchronization

## Known Limitations

* No authentication/authorization system
* Single-user application (no concurrency control beyond transactions)
* Limited to three databases (LD, AZ, GV)
* No web interface (command-line only)
* Manual data entry required for initial population
* No automated backup/recovery system

## Future Enhancements

* [ ] Implement web-based UI with REST API
* [ ] Add user authentication and role-based access control
* [ ] Add data visualization dashboard
* [ ] Implement stored procedures for complex operations
* [ ] Add machine learning for job matching recommendations
* [ ] Integrate with real job posting APIs (Indeed, Monster)
* [ ] Implement automated data synchronization between databases
* [ ] Add comprehensive logging and audit trails
* [ ] Create mobile application interface

## Educational Objectives

This project demonstrates mastery of:

* **Database Design**: ER modeling, normalization to 3NF, schema design
* **SQL Programming**: Complex queries, joins, subqueries, aggregations, set operations
* **JDBC Programming**: Database connectivity, prepared statements, transaction management, result set processing
* **Business Logic**: Translating real-world requirements into database operations
* **Data Integrity**: Foreign keys, constraints, cascading operations
* **Performance**: Indexing strategies, query optimization
* **Testing**: Unit testing, integration testing, data validation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue: Connection refused**
```
Solution: Verify database is running and connection parameters are correct
Check: lsof -i :5432 (PostgreSQL) or netstat -an | grep 3306 (MySQL)
```

**Issue: Foreign key constraint violations**
```
Solution: Ensure parent records exist before inserting child records
Check insertion order in Populate_tables.java
```

**Issue: Query returns no results**
```
Solution: Verify test data exists in tables
Run: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table_name; for each table
```

**Issue: Transaction deadlock**
```
Solution: Review transaction order, minimize transaction duration
Consider using explicit locking if necessary
